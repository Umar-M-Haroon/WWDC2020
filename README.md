Hi! 

This is my accepted submission for the 2020 WWDC Swift Student Challenge!

Used Technologies: ARKit, SceneKit, SwiftUI, a *tiny* bit of UIKit

The code is mostly in the template folder, but that requires Xcode 11.3 to be used. You can either run it via Xcode 11.3, or use the .playgroundbook and edit the files through there, but beware, that would make the test app in the template out of date.
