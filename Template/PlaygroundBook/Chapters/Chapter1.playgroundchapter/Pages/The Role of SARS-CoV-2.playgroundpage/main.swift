//: ## How does SARS-CoV-2 take advantage of this system?

/*:
 Viruses are unable to self-replicate as they don't have all of the machinery required to transform DNA to protein. This requires an alternative method: using a cell's machinery. As every cell has various differences, viruses become specific to one type of cell and will develop a method to enter and use the cell.

 SARS-CoV-2 has special spike proteins on the outer layer, also known as a membrane, which attach to specific cells that accept the shape of the protein. Once attached to a cell, the membrane of the virus opens and the virus' RNA is released into the cell. As the RNA is integrated into a cell, it is treated as any other piece of RNA and is translated into the specified proteins. These proteins when assembled result in a fully functioning virus. This cycle is repeated across as many cells as the virus infects

 For a virus as transmissive and effective as SARS-CoV-2, the best method to curb the spread is to stay home and use soap often as it dissolves the membrane, killing the virus.
