//: # What about RNA?

/*:
[RNA](glossary://RNA) is a similar to DNA, but has some differences. RNA is single stranded, which means that there is no second, connected strand. One of the other significant differences is that instead of the 4 base pairs ATGC, T is replaced by Uracil (or U). The new base pairs are A and U along with G and C.

### How is RNA made?
DNA goes through a process called [_transcription_](glossary://Transcription) which uses another set of machinery to convert the base pairs in DNA to RNA.

### So you have RNA, now what?
Once RNA is created, it can be used to build proteins. The bases are now fully utilized as their order determines what amino acids will be created, and therefore what protein is made.
Specific sequences of 3 bases, which is defined as a [_codon_](glossary://Codon). Each codon defines what amino acid is created. The RNA machinery finds a correct codon sequence and creates the appropriate amino acid chain (a.k.a a protein)

 ### So what is a protein?
 A protein is a combination of amino acids linked together that perform a specific function. Proteins have specific shapes that lead to certain functions.

 Every cell has various proteins that determine the cell's function. Some protein functions include: transport proteins, transcription of DNA to RNA, and even the creation of other proteins!
