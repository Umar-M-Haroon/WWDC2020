//: # A Transcription Exercise

/*:
## In this exercise, you're going to practice matching RNA bases from a DNA strand.

Now that we've discussed the basics of DNA and RNA and that DNA is transcribed to RNA, we're going to do another exercise. Try to fill the right RNA sequence from the *DNA* strand!
