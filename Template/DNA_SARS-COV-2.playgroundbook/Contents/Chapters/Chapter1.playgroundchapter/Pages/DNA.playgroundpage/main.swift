//: # So... What's DNA?

/*:
 [DNA](glossary://DNA) is a long molecule in a cell. DNA is assembled via 2 strands into a double helix. DNA contains 4 possible nitrogenous bases Adenosine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine, which are marked by the letters (ATGC). These bases form a [_base pair_](glossary://Base%20Pair). A forms a pair with T and G pairs with C. Any incorrect pairs here may lead to issues throughout the rest of the process

These bases when paired lead to 2 strands in the double helix.

/*:
### How does DNA replication work?

The cell has specific machinery to separate existing strands and create new along with proofreading and reassembly. These components are combined to form new DNA strands that are nearly identical to the parent generation
